# REST-API-Using-Python-Flask-Framework
Objective: To create a RESTful API using Flask to manage records (CRUD operations). The API should support the following endpoints:

GET /records: Fetch all records.
POST /records: Add a new record.
PUT /records/<id>: Update a record by ID.
DELETE /records/<id>: Delete a record by ID.
Bonus: Use JSON schema validation to validate input data when adding or updating records.
